receive an image, render the image using string of the choice.

MVP plan:

1. receive image
    image is just in path;
2. parse image
    use PIL to parse image; 
    Make it 2D array of pixels.
3. Analyze the image
    group the image into blocks of pixels, since characters are bigger than pixels.
    and calculate the average color of each block.
4. Render the image
    use the average color of each block to choose a string to represent the block.
    and render the image.
    each block is a character whose color is the average color of the block.
